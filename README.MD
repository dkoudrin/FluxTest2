**Introduction**
================
The following is my implementation of the Test Exercise given by HazardCo.
I have imported and copied some classes from my past selenium codebase
just to give an idea of structure. Obviously this code does not compile
or run (though I have made it as close as possible to that). 
I have parameterized the test class so that we can have a single copy of
the test but run it with multiple inputs (including a failure case).
