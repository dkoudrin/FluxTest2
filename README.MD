**Introduction**
================
The following is my implementation of the Test Exercise for QA Engineer Candidates at Flux Federation.
I have split it into three test methods as per the questions/instructions and I have added a BeforeClass
that runs before all the test code and gets the core data from the Trademe API.
I have chosen to use the RestAssured library for it's ease of use and well-known web presence. 

**Instructions**
================
To run the code/tests you can use your own development environment and download the github repository.
The tools I used were - Intellij, Java14 JDK, Maven, Junit, Git, Github. All the necessary libraries/dependancies
are specified in the pom.xml file, so you shouldn't need to manually download anything more than the
project files. Simply find the trademeAPITests file in your IDE
and either right click and run or open it and click the run 
button to run the entire class with all three test cases.
